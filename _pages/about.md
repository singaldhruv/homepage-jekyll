Hi! I am a data nerd who loves maths, statistics, finance and economics. **I am actively looking for full-time roles in the US (starting in Summer 2024) in research and development across software, quantitative finance and investment banking.**

Currently, I am a PhD resident at [(Google) X](https://x.company), where I am working on a moonshot to solve climate change using ML/AI and financial engineering.

Alongside that, I am a PhD student in Finance at [Columbia Business School](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu). I am interested in exploring research questions in Asset Pricing, Macroeconomics, Information Economics and International Finance. Previously, I was a research associate at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com), Bangalore where I worked on research projects in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Data Mining and Marketing.

I graduated from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in) in 2016. At IIT Kanpur, I worked on research projects in Machine Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory and Program Analysis.
