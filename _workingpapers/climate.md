abstract: "Quantifying impact of water scarcity on the economy and asset prices is challenging. We use a Ricardian approach to assess the impact of droughts in California on market valuations of farmland. Two factors aid our analysis---California's semi-arid conditions and quasi-exogenous shocks to groundwater and surface water availability. We combine novel geospatial data on water access, real estate transactions from Zillow, administrative boundaries and remote sensing imagery on crops and other characteristics. Our findings highlight the role of beliefs about climate risk in shaping the market equilibrium. We then extrapolate the differential impact of water scarcity on land prices to evaluate expected future cash flows."
