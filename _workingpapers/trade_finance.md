abstract: "Capital flows and trade flows have become increasingly global in the last few decades. How each of them affect the other is still unclear. We combine data on the global universe of corporate bonds (from Bloomberg and Reuters) with shipment-level trade data to study the linkages between firms' exposure via trade to foreign countries, as well as their activities in the debt markets of these countries."
