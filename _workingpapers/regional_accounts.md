abstract: "We construct a novel dataset which captures the geographic incidence of government revenues and expenditures. Government revenues and expenditures revenues and expenditures occur on three different levels in the United States: local, state, and federal. At all levels, government revenues and expenditures add and subtract resources from the private sector. The dataset encompasses all revenues and expenditures at the county-level from 2001-2019, and thus allows to see the net resource allocation through the government. We use this dataset to document several new facts about the relationship between economic activity and the resource allocation by the government."
