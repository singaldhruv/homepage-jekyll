Hi! I am a data nerd who loves maths, statistics, finance and economics.

Currently, I am a PhD resident at [(Google) X](https://x.company), where I am working on two moonshots to solve climate change using ML/AI and financial engineering.

Alongside that, I am a PhD student in Finance at [Columbia Business School](https://home.gsb.columbia.edu). I am interested in exploring research questions in asset pricing, macroeconomics, information economics and international finance. Previously, I was a research associate at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com), Bangalore where I worked on research projects in machine learning, computer vision, data mining and marketing.

I graduated from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in) in 2016. At IIT Kanpur, I worked on research projects in machine learning, algorithmic game theory and program analysis.
